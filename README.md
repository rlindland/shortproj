# Short Project Code

To reproduce the experiment, simply run the python notebook maskcode.ipynb and then run the stata files. The iptyhon notebook contains two cells, one to merge datasets and produce variables for experiment 1 and the other produce the data for experiment 2. The stata file runs the regression that yields the tables in the paper. 

The repository also includes several data sets:
- revenue.csv : a database of small business revenues at the county level
- covid.csv : a databse of COVID case, death, and testing data at the state level
- mask_compliance.csv : a survey of mask wearing frequency data on the county level
- covidcounty.csv : a databse of COVID case, death, and testing data at the county level
- co-est2019-alldata.csv : a databse with county level population
